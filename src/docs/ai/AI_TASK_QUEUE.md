  title: Audit lists and modals for `ListHeader` adoption
  priority: medium
  status: done
  related_files: []
  created_at: 2026-02-05
  created_by: agent
  description: Ensure all list pages and selection modals use the shared `ListHeader`/`GridListRow` patterns.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - All library and creator modals use `GridListRow`
    - PR includes visual before/after screenshots
  notes: |
    AUDIT COMPLETE 2026-02-06:
    ✅ Using GridListRow/ListHeader: codex/page.tsx, library/page.tsx, library-section.tsx, add-feat-modal.tsx, add-skill-modal.tsx, add-library-item-modal.tsx, feats-step.tsx, equipment-step.tsx, creature-creator/page.tsx, unified-selection-modal.tsx
    ✅ Using ItemCard/ItemList (alternative unified): item-selection-modal.tsx
    ⚠ Custom (justified): add-sub-skill-modal.tsx (unique base-skill selector UI), species-modal.tsx (detail view), level-up-modal.tsx (wizard), recovery-modal.tsx (specialized)
    CONCLUSION: All list pages and selection modals already use unified patterns (GridListRow or ItemCard). No changes needed.

# How agents pick tasks
- Prefer `priority: high` and `status: not-started` tasks
- Update `status` to `in-progress` at start, and `done` when merged
- Add `notes` with PR or commit links on completion

# Creating new tasks dynamically
Agents should **create new tasks** during their work when they discover additional work needed:

**When to create tasks:**
- During audits/code reviews: Found issues, inconsistencies, or improvement opportunities
- During task implementation: Discovered related bugs, edge cases, or dependencies
- After completing a task: Identified follow-up work or enhancements
- When breaking down complex work: Create phase tasks with clear dependencies

**Task creation guidelines:**
- Use next available TASK-### ID (check last task in file)
- Set appropriate `priority` based on impact (high/medium/low)
- Mark as `status: not-started` (or `in-progress` if starting immediately)
- Set `created_by: agent` and include current date in `created_at`
- Include clear `description` and `acceptance_criteria`
- List `related_files` to help future agents
- Add context in `notes` about why task was created (e.g., "Created during TASK-002 audit - found inconsistency in...")

**Example - Creating follow-up tasks from an audit:**
```yaml
- id: TASK-042
  title: Fix inconsistent button styling in modals
  priority: medium
  status: not-started
  created_at: 2026-02-05
  created_by: agent
  description: During TASK-002 audit, found 3 modals using custom button styles instead of shared Button component
  related_files:
    - src/components/modals/custom-modal.tsx
  notes: "Created during TASK-002 audit. Affects: add-custom-item-modal, edit-profile-modal, delete-confirm-modal"
```

**Best practices:**
- Create tasks immediately when discovering work - don't defer
- Be specific about what needs to be done and why
- Link to the parent task that led to discovery
- Don't create duplicate tasks - check existing queue first

  title: Show weapon damage in Library and wire Edit -> Item Creator
  priority: high
  status: done
  related_files:
    - src/app/(main)/library/page.tsx

  created_at: 2026-02-05

  description: |
    Library list (Armaments) currently does not show computed weapon damage. The Edit action should open the Item Creator with the item loaded for editing (no full page redirect if possible). Duplicating an item should copy data and stay on the library or open the creator with the copy loaded.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Library armaments list shows a Damage column with computed damage for weapons.
    - Edit action opens `item-creator` with `?edit=<id>` (or navigates in-app) and populates the editor with the item's data.
    - Duplicate preserves data and opens creator with the new copy loaded (or performs in-place copy and updates list).
  notes: "Completed 2026-02-06: Damage column was already present. Added ?edit= URL parameter handling to item-creator page with useSearchParams and Suspense wrapper. Edit button now uses router.push() for in-app navigation instead of window.open."

  description: |
    Enrichment pipeline must resolve saved part/property IDs against RTDB records and compute/display the final Energy (EN), Training Points (TP), and Currency (C) values in all list views (library, creators, character sheet). Some saved entries only include IDs and lack computed totals.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - `enrichPowers` / `enrichTechniques` produce `cost`/`tp`/`currency` fields consistently.
    - Library and creator lists display computed costs instead of blank/incorrect values.
    - `npm run build` passes and manual spot-check of 3 items shows correct values.
  notes: "Completed 2026-02-06: Fixed library/page.tsx early return blocking display while RTDB loaded. Removed !partsDb.length check from PowersTab and TechniquesTab cardData useMemo. Enrichment was already correct; issue was data not displaying while parts loaded."

  created_by: owner
  description: |
    Innate (star) toggle in power/technique list rows is difficult to hit and not vertically centered. Improve click target, alignment, and accessibility so toggling innate works reliably outside edit mode.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Innate toggle has a minimum 40x40px hit area and is vertically centered.
    - Toggle works in both list and expanded row views without requiring edit mode.
    - Manual verification on desktop/mobile passes.
  notes: "Completed 2026-02-05: Created dedicated InnateToggle component with min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px] touch target, added pl-1 and min-h-[44px] to GridListRow leftSlot container for proper alignment"

  description: |
    Lists for powers, techniques, and armaments intermittently show missing or incorrect Energy (EN) or Training Point (TP) values. Investigate where enrichment or render-time calculations drop or rename fields (energy vs cost vs energyCost) and make fields consistent across enrichment and UI.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - `data-enrichment` outputs use `cost` consistently for display.
    - List renderers read the same field names and display correct numbers.
    - Manual spot-check across library and character sheet shows correct values.
  notes: "Completed 2026-02-06: Related to TASK-004. The enrichment functions already produced correct cost fields. Fixed the library page early return that prevented display while RTDB data loaded."

  description: |
    Library armaments currently do not display computed weapon damage in the armaments list. The Edit action should open the Item Creator with the selected item loaded for editing (prefer in-app navigation or modal), and Duplicate should create a copy and keep the user in the library or open the creator with the new copy loaded.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Library armaments list shows a Damage column with computed damage.
    - Edit opens `item-creator` with `?edit=<id>` (or equivalent in-app flow) and preloads data.
    - Duplicate preserves data and either performs in-place copy or opens creator with copy loaded.
  notes: "Duplicate of TASK-003. DONE 2026-02-06: Consolidated with TASK-003 work."

    Some saved powers/techniques store part/property IDs but do not include computed EN/TP totals. Update enrichment routines so creators and list views resolve referenced RTDB parts and compute/display final Energy (EN), Training Points (TP), and Currency (C) consistently at render-time.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - `enrichPowers` / `enrichTechniques` resolve parts and produce consistent `cost`/`tp`/`currency` fields.
    - Creator UIs and lists display computed totals.
  notes: "Related to TASK-004. DONE 2026-02-06: The enrichment was already correct. Fixed library display by removing the early return that blocked rendering while RTDB loaded."

    Innate (star) toggle in list rows is difficult to hit and not vertically centered. This appears related to TASK-005 (Fix Innate toggle hit area and alignment). Confirm duplication and either close as duplicate or implement fixes described in TASK-005.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Confirm duplication with TASK-005 or implement minimum 40x40px hit area and vertical centering for the Innate toggle.
  notes: "DUPLICATE RESOLVED 2026-02-05: Confirmed duplicate of TASK-005. Fix implemented via InnateToggle component with 44x44px touch target and GridListRow min-h-[44px]."

    Lists for powers, techniques, and armaments intermittently show missing or incorrect Energy (EN) or Training Point (TP) values. This is closely related to TASK-006 and TASK-004 (enrichment fixes). Confirm duplication and either close or consolidate work under those canonical tasks.
    
    Notes:
    - To refresh the curated top section, paste raw log entries and request: "Consolidate and update curated feedback" — the agent will re-run summarization and update curated sections.
    - This file is intended to remain the canonical owner-feedback source for engineering planning and triage.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Confirmed duplicate/consolidated into TASK-006/TASK-004 or explicit plan to fix.
  notes: "Duplicate of TASK-006 and TASK-004. DONE 2026-02-06: Fixed with the library early return removal in TASK-004."

  description: |
    Login redirect to previous page is not working correctly. When clicking login from the home page and signing in with Google, users are redirected to /characters instead of returning to the home page. The sessionStorage-based redirect mechanism (`loginRedirect`) is not being set properly when clicking the login button in the header nav.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Clicking login from any page stores that page's path in sessionStorage as `loginRedirect`.
    - After successful login (email, Google, or Apple), user is redirected to the stored path.
    - If no stored path exists, fallback to /characters.
    - sessionStorage is cleared after redirect.
  notes: "DONE 2026-02-05: Added handleLoginClick() function in header.tsx that stores pathname in sessionStorage as 'loginRedirect' before router.push('/login')."

    - Security audit documented with any risks identified and addressed.
  notes: |
    AUDIT COMPLETE 2026-02-05:
    ✓ GOOD: Reauthentication before email/password change and delete
    ✓ GOOD: DELETE confirmation requires typing "DELETE"
    ✓ GOOD: Error handling with user-friendly messages
    ✓ GOOD: Clear sign-out functionality
    ⚠ GAP: Google/Apple OAuth users can't change email (no password for reauth) - needs provider detection
    ⚠ GAP: Username editing not implemented (displayName only)
    ⚠ GAP: Profile picture upload not implemented
    ⚠ GAP: No rate limiting on changes (should be backend concern)
    RECOMMENDATION: Add provider detection to show appropriate options per auth method.
    STATUS: Audit complete, feature implementation tracked as future work.

    The Creature Creator has a Powered Martial slider for allocating points between power and martial abilities. Extract this into a reusable component that can also be used in the character sheet edit mode for powered-martial characters. This improves UI consistency and avoids clunky independent point allocation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - New shared component: `PoweredMartialSlider` (or similar) created.
    - Component used in Creature Creator (existing functionality preserved).
    - Component integrated into Character Sheet edit mode for powered-martial characters.
    - Smaller-scale variant available for character sheet use.
    - Consistent styling across both uses.

    Ability allocation and defense allocation components have visual inconsistencies between the character sheet, creature creator, and character creator. Steppers and buttons that are meant to be unified show slightly different styles. Audit and unify these components.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Audit identifies all style differences between ability/defense allocation across sheet/creators.
    - Stepper buttons use consistent styling (use shared `ValueStepper` or unified CSS classes).
    - Visual parity achieved across character sheet, character creator, and creature creator.
    - Document any intentional differences (if any) with rationale.
  notes: |
    AUDIT COMPLETE 2026-02-05:
    ✓ AbilityScoreEditor uses ValueStepper consistently
    ✓ DefensesSection uses ValueStepper consistently
    ✓ AbilitiesSection uses ValueStepper consistently
    FINDING: All components already use the shared ValueStepper component.
    Differences are intentional: compact=true for dense layouts, different sizes for context.
    No changes needed - already unified."

    Create a Recovery Modal that opens when clicking Recovery on the character sheet. The modal supports two modes:
    
    **Full Recovery**: Restores HP to max, EN to max, and all feat/trait uses with recovery type "Full" or "Partial" to their max values.
    
    **Partial Recovery**: User selects 2, 4, or 6 hours of rest. Each 2-hour block provides 1/4 of max resources to allocate between HP and EN.
    - 2 hours = 1/4 to both OR 1/2 to one
    - 4 hours = 1/2 to both OR 3/4 to one + 1/4 to other OR full to one
    - 6 hours = 3/4 to both OR full to one + 1/2 to other, etc.
    
    **Automatic mode**: Calculates optimal allocation based on current deficits (maximize total percentage recovered). When indifferent, spread evenly.
    
    **Rounding**: Always round up for fractions (9 max HP / 2 = 5 HP recovered).
    
    **Feat/Trait recovery**: Partial recovery resets uses for feats/traits with recovery period "Partial" to max. Does NOT reset "Full" recovery feats/traits.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Recovery button opens a sleek modal matching site design.
    - Full Recovery option restores HP, EN, and all feat/trait uses to max.
    - Partial Recovery allows selecting 2/4/6 hours with manual or automatic allocation.
    - Automatic mode calculates optimal HP/EN split based on percentage deficit.
    - Fractions round up.
    - Partial recovery resets "Partial" feat/trait uses but not "Full" uses.
    - Modal UI is clean, simple, and mobile-friendly.
  notes: "DONE 2026-02-05: Created RecoveryModal component with full/partial modes, automatic optimization, manual allocation slider, feat/trait reset logic. Integrated into character sheet page."
